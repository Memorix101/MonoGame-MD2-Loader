MonoGame-MD2-Loader
===================

Quake MD2 Loader for XNA 4.0 / MonoGame

I ported the MD2 Loader by Matthew Lynch from XNA 1.0 to XNA 4.0 / MonoGame.

Original can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xnamd2/

The Mac version is seperated, because I had to make some little changes to the code.
